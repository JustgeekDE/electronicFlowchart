Electronic Flowchart - Physical flowchart components to create simple programs

Electronic Flowchart aims to make program flow charts more tangible. By connecting physical control nodes with actual wires and showing which node is active at any given time, the program flow is shown exp√∂licitly while it's happening

## ToDos:
- Code
### Nodes
- Register node
- Conditional node
- indirect register selector (mux / load) node
